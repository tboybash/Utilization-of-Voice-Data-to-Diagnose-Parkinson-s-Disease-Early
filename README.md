# Utilization-of-Voice-Data-to-Diagnose-Parkinson-s-Disease-Early
In this project, we explored how data can be used to improve health outcomes. The available data was Parkinson’s dataset which includes the health status of patients (healthy or not healthy) and 23 other voice measurement variables.  One of the questions I answered was whether the expected groups in the data are those that have or do not have Parkinson’s disease.  My motivation behind choosing this topic and this data set is my interest in exploring how data can be used in medicine to improve health outcomes. 

Using data to identify a new early diagnostic tool for Parkinson’s is potentially a great example of this. This report will focus on two questions:  

1)Which voice measurement variables are most associated with having Parkinson’s disease? 
2)Are the expected groups in the data, of those that do and do not have Parkinson’s disease, distinct and observable?
